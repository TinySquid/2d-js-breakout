## About

You can play the game here: https://mike-2d-breakout.netlify.com/

This project was made so that I can practice mastering javascript module import / exports and generally to just sharpen my skills in javascript. I have almost completely re-written the code to be ES6 (Arrow funcs, let, const, etc).
